I'm an undergraduate student from Edmonton, Alberta! I'm midway through my
bachelors studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My main line of
work/interests are regarding cultural psychology and psychopathology, with a
neuroscience emphasis. I'll be joining the lab this summer under the PREP
program, working on the general architecture of the Diseasome, and using it to
examine genetic and physiological mechanisms behind psychological disorders.
Other interests include: Sociology, Basketball, Handball, Ethics, Traveling,
Literature
