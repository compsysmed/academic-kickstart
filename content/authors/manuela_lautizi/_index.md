I’m a PhD student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics in collaboration
with the Institute of Pathology, both at TUM. I’ve originally joined Prof.
Baumbach’s lab to work on my master’s thesis in bioinformatics, focused to
identify pathway-based subnetwork of genes most significantly associated to
survival time of cancer patients. Other topics of my interest are machine
learning (both supervised and unsupervised), manipulation and analysis of the
data from a statistical point of view.
