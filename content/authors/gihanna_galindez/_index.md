I'm a PhD student at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TU Munich. I
obtained my bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from the
University of the Philippines. Then, I studied Life Science Informatics at
the University of Bonn in Germany. In my master's thesis, I used machine
learning to identify chromatin features involved in immunity-related
transcriptional reprogramming in plants. I am working under the REPO-TRIAL
project to apply network analysis and machine learning for drug repurposing.
