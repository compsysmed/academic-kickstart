I'm a PhD candidate at the chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TUM. My
project is the study of alternative splicing in heart and kidney using machine
learning to analyze multi-omics data. I studied cellular biology, specializing
in the mitochondria, during my Master's at LMU. For my Master's thesis, I
explored splicing within ribosomal protein genes, in the context of the
biogenesis of mitochondria.
