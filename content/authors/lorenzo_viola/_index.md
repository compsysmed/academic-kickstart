I'm a master student in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University,
Rome. My curriculum is focused on data mining and management, also on a large
scale. A bioinformatics course has inspired me to join the Chair of
Experimental Bioinformatics for developing my thesis project, dealing with
multimodal network-based epistasis detection on a genome-wide scale.
