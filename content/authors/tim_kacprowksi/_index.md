I'm a research group leader at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics.  My
group works on network biology, multi omics integration and machine learning in
the context of systems medicine.  Previously, I spent some time in Odense,
Denmark, as a guest researcher at the Syddansk Universitet.  In my graduate
studies at the University of Greifswald, I analysed different omics data in the
context of common diseases. Before I joined the Interfaculty Institute of
Functional Genomics at the University Medicine Greifswald, I studied
bioinformatics in Saarbr√ºcken, focussing on network biology. During my studies
I spent some time abroad at the University of Iceland. I've been awarded a Honor's
Degree in Bioinformatics from the Saarland University and the
Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics.
