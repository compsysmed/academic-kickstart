I'm a Bachelor student in Bioinformatics at the Technical Univerity of
Munich an the Ludwig-Maximilian University. In October 2019 I joined the
Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics in Weihenstephan to work on my
bachelor thesis on the indentification of miRNA binding site enriched
transcripts in The Cancer Genome Atlas.
