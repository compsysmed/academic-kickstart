I will start in summer 2019 as a Postdoc at the Chair of Experimental
Bioinformatics. I graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University and did PhD
in Kharkevich Institute in Moscow at professor Gelfand lab. There I studied the
evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks in bacteria. During my PhD I
shortly stayed at Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas-City, where I
went on working on regulation of bacterial metabolic pathways. As a research
scientist, I worked in Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow on
3D chromatin structure analysis.
