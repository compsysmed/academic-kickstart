I study bioinformatics since Oct‘2018 in Munich with a research interest in
human genetics and cancer biology. Before that I received a master’s degree in
biology at the LMU Munich. During my studies, I focused on molecular and cell
biology and protein biochemistry. I recently joined the Chair of Experimental
Bioinformatics as a Hiwi to work on the diseasome project for a better
understanding of a disease-gene interactions.
