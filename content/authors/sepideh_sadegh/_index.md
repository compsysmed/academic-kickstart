I am a PhD student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TU Munich. I
received my Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Amirkabir
University of Technology (Tehran, Iran) and my Master’s degree in
Bioinformatics from Saarland University (Saarbrücken, Germany). In my master
thesis I analyzed disease-specific gene regulatory networks in terms of
co-regulatory network motifs. My research interests include multi-omics data
and network biology. I am currently involved in REPO-TRIAL, a H2020 funded drug
repurposing project.
