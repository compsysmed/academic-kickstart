summary = "The EU H2020 project REPO-TRIAL aims at developing an _in silico_ approach to optimise the efficacy and precision of drug repurposing trials. To this end we integrate heterogeneous data into a comprehensive interactome of disease-drug-gene interactions (a new diseasome) and develop graph-based machine learning approaches to investigate this highly complex data."
