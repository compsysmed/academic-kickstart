summary = "BiGAnts is a powerful new systems medicine tool to stratify patients while elucidating the responsible disease mechanisms. BiGAnts is a network-constrained biclustering approach which restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and maximizes the expression difference between two subgroups of patients."
