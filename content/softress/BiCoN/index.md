# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "BiCoN is a powerful new systems medicine tool to stratify patients while elucidating the responsible disease mechanisms. BiCoN is a network-constrained biclustering approach which restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and maximizes the expression difference between two subgroups of patients. A package for network-constrained biclustering of patients and multi-omics data can also be used. Download and installation instructions can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/bicon/)."
